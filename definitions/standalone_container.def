    # the container has been bootstrapped. In this case, it is used to create
    # all the folders that are needed for the final container to run.

%files
    # Files are copied from the host filesystem to the container filesystem.
    # Caution is needed in using relative paths for files on the host, because
    # the working directory will be set as the folder from which is executed
    # the apptainer build command.

%environment
    # The LC_ALL environment variable is used to set the locale for all locale
    # categories to the specified value, in this case, C. Setting LC_ALL to C
    # enforces the use of the standard "C" locale, which is a POSIX locale.
    # This can be useful for ensuring consistent behavior across different
    # environments, especially in terms of sorting, formatting, and character
    # encoding. It is often used to ensure reproducibility and to avoid locale-related
    # issues in scripts and applications that might behave differently under different
    # locale settings.

    export LC_ALL=C


%runscript

    # entry point, aka the command that will be run inside the container.
    # To use a container like this, it is necessary to use the --bind option
    # "which will be explained later. The $@ means that to the executed command
    # (in this case /funtaxis-lite/launcher.sh) will be passed all options
    # declared after the call to the container via apptainer exec.
